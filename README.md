# HPC

Repo for a select subset of the scripts submitted towards the 'Techniques of High Performance Computing' module during my MSc Scientific Computing, under Timo Betcke.

Both projects involve the design and implementation of OpenCL kernels to provide parallel code execution over generic device types, with a comparison of the performance gains from implementing this multithreading.
